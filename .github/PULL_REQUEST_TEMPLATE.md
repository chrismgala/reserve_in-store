# What did you do here?
* *Briefly explain what you did*

# Demo
* For each flow, post a video/gif or link to one: (`![](https://www.fera.ai/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/cdyUNSv9bq.gif)`). If what was changed in the image/gif/video is not totally clear 
*  If you only changed a single thing on a single static page and your changes don't affect any user flows, then a screenshot image is acceptable.

# Good PR Checklist
- [ ] I believe my code is complete and in working condition.
- [ ] I've documented my public methods and any other methods I think need to be documented.
- [ ] I've scanned my code for any left-behind test code.
- [ ] I've written automated tests for my code and/or updated existing ones  (or I've been told I can skip them)
- [ ] I've included: 
    (A) video/gif(s) of my changes, 
    *and/or* (B) or a screenshot since my changes only affect one screen, 
    *and/or* (C) it is not possible to post screenshots
